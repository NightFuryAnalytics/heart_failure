# Predicting Death By The No.1 Serial Killer in the World
## Overview
We performed our analysis on a dataset of Pakistani heart patients (299 records with 12 features) in a bid to answer the following research questions:
1) How do specific underlying conditions, such as age, diabetes, and ejection fraction, influence the likelihood of death in individuals with heart failure?
2) Are smokers more likely to die than non-smokers?
3) Are there any associations between key variables, such as level of serum sodium and serum creatinine in individuals with deaths from heart failure?

## ML Models:
Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Trees.
